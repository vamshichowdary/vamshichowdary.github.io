I come from Hyderabad, India and I work as a part-time marketing agent for Hyderabadi Biryani. I play Basketball and follow NBA religiously (Steph Curry is the GOAT btw). I love to read for fun and I struggle finding non-serious science fiction books like *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* and *The Foundation Series* and so I just end up reading a lot of non-fiction. If you have some suggestions please leave them at [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44225807-vamshi-chowdary). Lately I have been developing some interest in old Telugu literature and also enjoying learning Piano on the Keyboard. I love [Vivek Sagar's music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7Fa8B0rJSmeeGjYCJJXrb3). Now if you want to know some boring stuff about me, read on.

I am a first year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California Santa Barbara, advised by [Prof. Shivkumar Chandrasekaran](http://scg.ece.ucsb.edu/people.html). My research currently focusses on developing theoretical frameworks for deep learning and using computer vision as a test bench to test our theories. I recently finished my Masters with thesis titled : ["A study of Generalization in Deep Neural Networks"](https://vamshichowdary.github.io/publications/msthesis).

During the summer of 2020, I worked as an Intern at [Briteseed](https://www.briteseed.com), Chicago, training neural networks on hyperspectral imaging data.

From 2016-2019 I worked as a Software Engineer at Samsung R&D Institute, Delhi developing audio processing algorithms and ML models for predicting music genres from audio data. I graduated from IIT Roorkee in 2016 with a Bachelors degree working on developing low-cost display devices using Au/Ag Nanoparticles, advised by [Prof. Brijesh Kumar](https://www.iitr.ac.in/~ECE/Brijesh_Kumar) and [Prof. Sanjeev Manhas](https://www.iitr.ac.in/~ECE/Manhas__Sanjeev).
